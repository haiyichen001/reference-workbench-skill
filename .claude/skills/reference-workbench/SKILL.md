# Reference Workbench

Single pipeline: **Write → Self-Audit → Auto Quick Check → (when done) Offer Deep Check**.

- After every write operation, run a **silent quick check** — no user prompt needed.
- When the user is done with all changes, **ask once** whether to upgrade to normal or deep.

---

## Phase 0 — MCP Dependency Check

Scan MCP tools. Output two lines — search first, then tools:

```
Search:  arxiv ✅ | scholar ✅ | paper-search ✅ | crossref ✅
Tool:    pdf-reader ✅
```

If any required MCP is missing, stop and output install commands. Also run `python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/setup.py` to check Python and `rich`.

---

## Phase 1 — Determine Task

Auto-detect from user input. Do NOT ask "which mode?".

| User says (keywords) | Action |
|----------------------|--------|
| write, draft, rewrite, review, literature, intro, 写, 综述, 引言, 草稿 | → Phase 2 (Writing) |
| check, verify, audit, validate, 查, 验, 检测 | → Phase 3 (Verification directly) |
| Provides a file | Read file → go directly to Phase 3 (Verification) |

If ambiguous ("帮我看看这篇论文") and no file given, default to Writing.

---

## Phase 2 — Writing & Self-Audit

Core loop: **normalize → run `cite_table.py` → relay table → self-audit**.

1. **LLM normalizes**: convert ANY citation format (`[REF01]`, `\cite{key}`, `[@key]`, bare `[1]`, etc) to `[CITE:descriptiveKey]`
2. **Script verifies**: `cite_table.py` only reads `[CITE:key]`. Hard-coded, deterministic.
3. **Table proves**: every normalized citation appears in output — nothing missed or invented.

### When NOT to Use

Single-paper summary, pure grammar polishing, non-academic writing, format conversion only.

### Five Scenarios

| User says | Agent does |
|-----------|-----------|
| New review | Draft with `[CITE:xxx]` → script → **table** |
| Rewrite draft | Normalize existing citations to `[CITE:xxx]` → script → **table** |
| Add citation | Insert `[CITE:xxx]` → re-run script → **table** |
| Remove citation | Remove `[CITE:xxx]` → re-run script → **table** |
| Audit | Re-run script → checks → **table** |

Every scenario ends: `cite_table.py` → `Read cite_output.txt` → paste table + checks. Then proceed to **silent quick check** below.

The draft always uses `[CITE:descriptiveKey]` placeholders. The script numbers them and outputs the table — but the source of truth is the draft itself. Self-audit checks are always performed against the draft with `[CITE:xxx]` placeholders, never against the numbered output alone.

### Always-On Checks

After every citation change, re-run `cite_table.py` and walk through:

1. **Stacking** — >3 in one bracket? Warn. >5? Block.
2. **Format** — venue mismatch? Load `references/citation-formats.md` (on-demand) when user specifies a venue. Re-check after ref generation.
3. **Order** — gaps or jumps? Script catches this.
4. **Orphan** — in-text count != reference count? Report.
5. **Tone** — `references/diplomatic-critique.md` (loaded at startup). Never "fails to", "ignores", "fundamentally flawed".
6. **Citation depth** — most citations: **who + did what + found what + `[CITE:xxx]`**. Opening/transition sentences can be broad. Body paragraphs: each cited paper gets its own sentence.
   - Two valid positions: sentence-end (`...reduced errors by 23% [CITE:smith2023].`) or natural pause (`...as shown in prior work [CITE:jones2021;CITE:lee2022], the trend...`).
   - NEVER: `, [CITE:xxx],` (comma sandwich) or `Smith [CITE:smith2023] proposed` (author-attached). Script flags these as ⚠️.

Report: one line per check, `✅` or `⚠️`. Then full re-scan (never fix one and skip the rest). Then read all `[CITE:xxx]` aloud from the draft to catch awkward flow.

### Table Protocol (Mandatory)

Auto-detect `.bib` file in project dir. If found, use `--bib` mode.

```
python ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cite_table.py <draft> [--bib <bib_file>]
Read: ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/cite_output.txt
→ Paste table + audit. Then: "Need to add, remove, or change any citations?"
```

Without `--bib`: 5 columns (# | Author | Body Context | Reference | Status). With `--bib`: 6 columns comparing body order, bib key, bib position, and reference list order. Bilingual (中文/English auto-detected). Repeated citations get `↳` sub-rows.

### Reference Files

- `anti-laziness-protocol.md` — **loaded at startup**. Mandatory 5-step verification gate. Itemized only, no batching.
- `citation-placement-rules.md` — **loaded at startup**. Per-citation placement enforcement.
- `diplomatic-critique.md` — **loaded at startup**. Mandatory tone guard.
- `citation-formats.md` — **loaded on-demand** when user specifies a venue. IEEE/SCI/EI/GB7714/APA/MLA/Chicago/ACM rules.
- `citation-fields.md` — **loaded on-demand** for metadata cross-checking by citation type.

### Script

- `cite_table.py` — single core engine. Scan, number, table, position check, bilingual, `--bib` mode.

---

## Phase 3 — Auto Quick Check (Silent, Small Drafts Only)

After every write scenario completes, count unique `[CITE:xxx]` placeholders:

| Unique citations | Action |
|-----------------|--------|
| < 2 | Skip — draft has no real reference list yet |
| 2 – 4 | **Run silent quick check** |
| ≥ 5 | **Skip** — defer to Phase 5 (too many citations for per-edit checking) |

When the threshold is met (2–4 refs):

1. Extract all unique `[CITE:xxx]` placeholders from the draft
2. For each, run a **quick** existence check only (no metadata/content layers):
   - Try DOI lookup → arXiv lookup → title search. Stop at first hit.
   - If all fail → flag as ❓ unchecked
3. Output a one-line summary:

```
Quick check: 3 refs — 3 found ✅
```

No AskUserQuestion. If all found → no extra output beyond the summary line. If any unchecked → flag it and note that Phase 5 will offer a deeper check.

---

## Phase 4 — Deep Citation Verification (On Request)

Reachable via two paths:
- **Direct**: user provides a file and says "check citations" → start here after Phase 0
- **Upgrade**: after completing all writing, Phase 5 offers this → jump here

### 4.1 — Ask Scope & Depth

Call `AskUserQuestion` with two questions:

**Question 1 — Scope (single-select)**
- header: "Scope"
- options:
  - `all` / "Verify all (M unique papers)"
  - `selected` / "Manual selection (e.g. 1,3,5-8)"
- multiSelect: false

**Question 2 — Depth (single-select)**
- header: "Depth"
- options:
  - `quick` / "Quick — Abstract/TLDR only (~10-15k tokens/citation)"
  - `normal` / "Normal — Abstract+Intro+Conclusion (~20-50k tokens/citation) [Recommended]"
  - `deep` / "Deep — Full-text section-by-section (~50-150k tokens/citation) [Token-heavy]"
- multiSelect: false

Wait for user response before Phase 4.2.

### 4.2 — Read File

| Format | Method |
|--------|--------|
| PDF | `mcp__pdf-reader__read_pdf` |
| DOCX | `python-docx` via Bash |
| TXT/MD | `Read` |
| LaTeX | `Read` + parse `\cite{}` `\bibitem{}` |

### 4.3 — Extract Citations

Output raw list:
```
File: paper.pdf (5 pages) | Found N citations | Type: journal/conference/...

[1] journal | Vaswani et al. (2017) "Attention Is All You Need"
    Location: §I, "code-centric automation..."
[2] ...
```

### 4.4 — Deduplicate

Normalize by **title + first author** (title: strip punctuation, lowercase; first author: last name). Same paper cited multiple times → merge, keep all locations.

```
Dedup: N raw → M unique papers (N-M duplicates removed)

[1,7]  journal | Vaswani et al. (2017) "Attention Is All You Need"
       Locations: §I "code-centric..." / §III "self-attention enables..."
[2]    conference | ...
[3,5,9] preprint | ...
```

### 4.5 — Parallel Verification (10 per round)

#### Rules
- Strictly 10 unique papers per round, overflow auto-continues
- Each paper gets one independent general-purpose sub-agent, **all launched in parallel**
- Agents update status via TaskUpdate
- Round completes → auto-advance to next round

#### Single-paper agent task

Each agent receives: original number list (e.g. `[1,7]`), title, authors, year, DOI/ArXiv ID (if available), context around each citation location (±3 sentences).

Three-layer check:

**Layer A — Existence (with fallback chain)**

Try each step in order. Any success → stop. Max 1 retry per step (timeout/network). Failure → next step.

| Priority | Condition | Tool | On failure |
|----------|-----------|------|------------|
| 1 | Has DOI | `mcp__scholar__get_paper` | → Priority 2 |
| 2 | Has ArXiv ID | `mcp__arxiv__get_abstract` | → Priority 3 |
| 3 | Has title | `mcp__scholar__search_papers` (full title) | → Priority 4 |
| 4 | Title search failed | Strip punctuation, quote core phrase, keep 5-8 words, retry `mcp__scholar__search_papers` | → Priority 5 |
| 5 | Title search still failed | `mcp__arxiv__search_papers` | → Priority 6 |
| 6 | Previous two failed | `mcp__paper-search__search_google_scholar` | → Priority 7 |
| 7 | Only author+year+keywords | `mcp__scholar__search_papers` (author + 2-3 core keywords) | → Priority 8 |
| 8 | All above failed | `WebSearch` (paper title + "paper" / "pdf") | → Unverifiable |

Record every fallback path. Final report shows actual data sources used.

**Layer B — Metadata**

Cross-check against `references/citation-fields.md`. Author, title, journal, year, volume/issue/pages are mandatory match fields.

**Layer C — Content support (depth set by user in Phase 4.1)**

| Depth | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| quick | Abstract + TLDR |
| normal | Abstract + Introduction + Conclusion |
| deep | Full-text section by section |

Extract the claim at each citation location, compare with actual paper content: supports / exaggerates / unrelated / contradicts.

## Phase 5 — Final Deep Check Offer

When the user indicates they are done with all writing (session ending, "looks good", "done", "submit", etc.), call `AskUserQuestion` with one question:

**Question — Upgrade to deeper check? (single-select)**
- header: "Final Check"
- options:
  - `normal` / "Normal — re-verify with Abstract+Intro+Conclusion (~20-50k tokens/citation) [Recommended]"
  - `deep` / "Deep — full-text section-by-section (~50-150k tokens/citation) [Token-heavy]"
  - `no` / "No — quick checks were sufficient"
- multiSelect: false

Context: mention how many quick checks ran and how many refs passed ("We ran 3 quick checks on 15 refs — all found. Upgrade to a deeper verification?").

If user chooses `normal` or `deep` → jump to Phase 4 with that depth and `all` scope.
If user chooses `no` → output: "Done. Run `/reference-workbench check <file>` anytime to re-verify."

---

## Optional MCPs (Not Required)

These enhance the skill but are not mandatory. If missing, the skill runs normally.

| MCP | What it adds | Install |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| **Zotero** | Search your Zotero library, import papers, read PDF annotations, write Word docs with live citations | `npx smithery install @alisoroushmd/zotero-mcp` |
| **DeepL** | Academic translation (中文 ↔ English), glossary-locked terminology, rephrase for clarity | `npm install deepl-mcp-server` (needs free API key) |

If installed, the agent can use them automatically during write sessions for reference management and translation tasks.
